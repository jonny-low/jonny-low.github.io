## Background

In the contemporary landscape of healthcare delivery, the digitization of medical records has revolutionized patient care by enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of health information. As healthcare organisations increasingly transition towards electronic medical record (EMR) systems, the need for standardized data reporting becomes imperative. Despite the undeniable advantages offered by EMRs, the lack of uniformity in data reporting poses significant challenges. Without standardized reporting protocols, the interoperability between different EMR systems is compromised, hindering seamless information exchange among healthcare providers. Consequently, this fragmentation impedes clinical decision-making, patient safety, and overall healthcare quality. As medical informations are input via computer / tablets acting as the client, it is crucial for a standard reporting features being implemented to address the above challenges especially in mental health using ISBAR framework.


## Goal
The project aim is to further improve existing MentalTAC prototype by standardizing the data reporting generated.   

## Method
This project will be developed using the software development life cycle framework. The data standardization will be based on [OMOP Common Data Model](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/) which is an open community data standard.
