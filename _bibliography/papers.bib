  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

        abstract = {Distribution of multimedia content through the Internet has become a trend in the present technology-aged community. Network supported multimedia applications involve many different transmission capabilities which are used to deliver content through streaming to a wide range of terminals and users are surrounded by different environments that are acting under totally different circumstances. However, significant challenges have come as streaming media points out to corporations and individuals the limits of their information infrastructure. These limits crash against the users? demands for smooth video, clear audio, and performance levels specified and guaranteed by contract. Various researches on Internet network protocols minimization are currently on-going to combine the transport of all types of network traffic across a single multi-service common core network. Hence, end-to-end bandwidth estimation is one of the criteria and plays an important role in providing quality of service (QoS) to users. The challenge is then to produce bandwidth management that are adaptable and efficient for varying traffic conditions. In this research, an improved probe-rate method to measure available bandwidth called Bandshaper was proposed to cater for the scalable multimedia streaming needs. The proposed method which improves in terms of estimation accuracy and computation time are evaluated against the original technique.}
