## Background
The Software Engineering (SE) workforce is still male-dominated, and there are still fewer female students graduating from Computer Science/Software Engineering (CS/SE) courses in most countries. Two major reasons are fewer women enrolling in CS/SE courses and a lower percentage of those women who enrolled completing courses. We wanted to investigate the second reason - the experiences of students within the CS/SE education environment to identify key issues that need improvement to increase female student recruitment and completion.


## Goal
- Explore studentsâ€™ perceptions of gender inclusivity in the CS environment, focusing on resources that promote inclusive teaching, learning, and assessment content.
- To identify areas for improvement in the CS classroom and provide insights that can help enhance inclusivity.
- Promote a more diverse and equitable learning environment.


## Method
We interviewed 18 CS/SE students to explore their experiences based on Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). We requested they review selected SE education content to understand the perception of gender diversity within the SE education environment.
